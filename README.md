## Abstract
This presentation demonstrates the use of Desmos teacher activities to teach concepts in foundation mathematics & physics. Activities have been developed1 using the online education platform Desmos (2021) to introduce students to kinematics. Online exercises are more important than ever in the pandemic era of short-notice lockdowns and remote teaching. Having interactivity available in a template that can be demonstrated in lecture, or, if necessary, can be accessed independently by students at home, is a valuable resource.

One-dimensional kinematics exercises were developed using the teacher-Desmos feature to introduce students to the topic. Students are taken through a range of possibilities with the help of an interactive script to provide input, output, and visual feedback. This is accomplished through the computation layer scripting language built into the platform. Students can type answers into the activity that are stored for feedback or peer viewing. The subsequent 2-D topic builds on the first instance and enhances student understanding of concepts such as vectors and maximum range in physics and derivatives and their applications in mathematics. 

Showing students a Desmos graphing calculator version with equations exposed created confusion and distracted from engaging with the concepts of kinematics. The teacher activity version puts the code (and equations) in the background leaving students free to discuss concepts at hand. Displaying and annotating the velocity vectors and range made it easy to highlight characteristics of projectile motion. Student engagement was better using an interactive web-based activity than paper-based structured learning or mixed media and student conversation revealed rich discussion.
